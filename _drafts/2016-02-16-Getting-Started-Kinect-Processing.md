Processing was the first programming language I tinkered with. It's a language for creative coding developed by Daniel Schiffman. It is used to create visual graphics using code.

I have been interested in using it with the Kinect for a while but with newer versions being released, the examples I was interested in did not work anymore and I have not enough knowledge in Processing to be able to debug them so when I found these video tutorials by Daniel Schiffman, I got really excited cause this is exactly what I needed!
