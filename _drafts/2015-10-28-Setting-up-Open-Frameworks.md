I'm trying to experiment more and more with creative coding and one of the main tools for this is OpenFrameworks.
OF is a software framework designed to assist programmers in their creative process to build experiences. It is open-source and written in C++.

You can use it with Xcode but the most recent version of the IDE (7.0) is not totally compatible with the version of OF you can download on the site.
There are a few changes to make to get the examples running.
