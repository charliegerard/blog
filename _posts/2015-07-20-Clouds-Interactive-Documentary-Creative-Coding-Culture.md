I am sharing this as I am reading it: I just discovered a new documentary called <a href="http://www.cloudsdocumentary.com/" target="_blank">Clouds</a> about the Creative Coding culture. :D

I haven't had time to watch it yet so I don't even know if it's any good but just the fact that we're talking more and more about the Creative Coding culture makes me so happy!

I love generative art. I discovered that when I started programming but I realise that so many developers are not even aware of what it is (or don't give a shit)!

Also, if you're into this or not, they released an Oculus Rift version so anyway, maybe you should give it a try. ;)
