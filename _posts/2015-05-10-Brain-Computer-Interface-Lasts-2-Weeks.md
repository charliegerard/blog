The evolution of research around brain activity has led scientists to a new invention. They managed to create a wearable conductive gel that sticks on the skin without irritating it and that allows to track and collect brain signals.

These wearable electrodes stick onto and near the ear like a temporary tattoo and can be used for more than 2 weeks without being damaged by normal activity.

This invention could allow a better collection and analysis of brain waves and be the beginning of better prosthetics and interfaces for people with disabilities by being able to control devices with your brain.

Before this, brain signals were analysed using Electroencephalograms with electrodes stuck onto the head with conductive gel. This technique only allowed short-term collection as the gel would deteriorate and the electrodes would have to be changed.

This new method proved to be working for more than 14 days despite showering and exercising. It consists of a flexible collection of gold electrodes on a soft plastic film and sticks to the skin using electric forces better known as van der Walls interaction.

To record the brain activity, the sensors were connected to a monitoring device using stretchable wires. This device recorded well enough to enable patients to spell words using their thought.

This type of invention could revolutionise the life of people with disabilities for whom mind-controlled devices would considerably change their life.
